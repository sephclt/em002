         <h2>About Me</h2>
         <p>Seph is a computer science student who is interested in everything that has to do with programming. He started his programming journey after having no choice but to install and use Linux which led to his interest in low-level programming like OS Development and Game Engine Development. Currently developing his game engine from scratch, he uses his free time to research and learn.</p>
